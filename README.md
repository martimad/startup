# Project Overview

## Introduction
For my startup, I am developing a website dedicated to my nail services. As I currently work in a salon and operate a small business, enhancing my online presence is essential for attracting new clients and engaging with existing ones.

## Purpose
The website will serve a dual purpose: 
1. To educate potential clients about the services I offer.
2. To encourage clients to make appointments easily.

To facilitate this, I will integrate my existing booking service into the site, allowing clients to view real-time availability.
Clients can also recieve education on potential services the site. Many clients may be unfamiliar with the services I provide or their specifics. To address this, the website will feature detailed explanations and educational content about each service, helping clients understand what they need to book.

## Technology Stack

### HTML
HTML will be utilized to create the structure of the website and organize content effectively. For instance, the portfolio tab will utilize a grid layout to display images, while the services tab will likely use a list format to outline all available services. The homepage will feature a prominent banner and headings.

### CSS
CSS will be employed for styling purposes. The homepage will feature a rotating banner showcasing various elements. Different fonts will be applied to titles and text to personalize the look, and colors will highlight selected tabs, improving user navigation.

### JavaScript
JavaScript will add functionality to buttons and links throughout the site. This includes numerous "Book Now" links and integrated systems, such as Instagram feeds. JavaScript will enable interactivity, allowing users to engage with the content dynamically.

### React
React will perform similar functions to JavaScript, enhancing user experience by linking my booking site to the webpage, enabling smooth scrolling, and routing clients to external pages and links.

### Web Service
The website will incorporate an integrated booking system, which will display my calendar to clients on the front end. Additionally, my Instagram account will be linked, allowing clients to view my portfolio without requiring multiple updates.

### Authentication
A user authentication system will allow clients to log in and access their appointment history, including the number of appointments they have had, their next appointment date, and a referral link.

### Websocket
A WebSocket connection will be utilized to display real-time information about scheduled appointments and gaps in my calendar, ensuring clients have the most accurate information available.

## Conclusion
This project aims to create a comprehensive online platform for my nail services, enhancing client education and streamlining the booking process while leveraging modern web technologies.
